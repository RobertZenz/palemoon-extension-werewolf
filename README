Werewolf - A Palemoon Extension
===============================

This extension allows to customize the GUI of [Palemoon](http://www.palemoon.org/) by providing a plethora of various settings.

This extension is the successor to [ThinBars](https://github.com/RobertZenz/ThinBars), [ThinBookmarks](https://github.com/RobertZenz/ThinBookmarks) and [ThinTabs](https://github.com/RobertZenz/ThinTabs)), so these extensions should be removed before Werewolf is installed.
